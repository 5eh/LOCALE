## **LIVE CUSTOMERS**

#### **RESEARCH NOTES**:

1. (Fashinza) Potential opportunity is categorizing products on **LOCALE** by `product sustainbility / envrionmentally sustainable`, maybe also `animal welfare`
2. (Fashinza) Costs of promotions include: `advertising costs`, `free samples`, `publications`, `bulletins`
3. (Fashinza) Counterfits are a concern
4. (Dreamweaver) A lot/majority of people rely on `third-party recommendations` or reviews from others who have purchased the products before before designing.
5. (Dreamweaver) People would like to have their own SEO'd brand if it's an ecom website in order to grow online presence. 
6. (Dreamweaver) Instagram is a big avenue for posts and local community, hashtag optimization as well. 
7. (Dreamweaver) Consider KPIs `[Consider human KPIs, that reflect human interaction beyond statistics]`
8. (Dreamweaver) `Sphere of Influence` who organically share their posts and testimonials to spread brand name
9. (Quora) Repeat clientele: Getting initial customers is easy relative to keeping them.
