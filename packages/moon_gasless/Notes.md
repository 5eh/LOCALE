# Notes

I read the [Gassless tutorial](https://docs.moonbeam.network/tutorials/eth-api/call-permit-gasless-txs/#__tabbed_2_4)
Problem: People have to hold Glimmer
Solution: Use diffrent token or someone else pays
Example: Game.
Use via call permit precompile.
We buy DPS as an example and pay the gas via precompile.
We will cover attacks as well.
We need ethers and moonbase Alpha Acc.
