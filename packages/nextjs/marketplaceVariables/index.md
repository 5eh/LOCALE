# Notes

This is the primary section of each marketplace where all variables, API links, and database collections will be hosted. This area will have a set standard of marketplace variables that will change according to each marketplace creation. This is the core functionality and core part of the factory we are producing.

This folder will need to be categorized, formalized and rationally distributing all relevant data.

Folder suggestions:
[*] Styling
[*] Headers/Paragraphs
[*] API routes
[*] Database connections
[*] Constants to Environment variables
[*] Currency Conversion
[*] Regional Translation Conversion
[*] SEO optimization
[*] Form input requirements
[*] Web3 Functionality
[*] ... more

# Files

1. Index.js - This hosts the primary variables, this includes:

- Marketplace: Name | Type | Holding Company | Service Provider
- Transaction Fees: Percentage Charge
- Currency: Currency | Currency Symbol
- Notifications Format: Border | Background | Color | Padding | Font Weight
- Database Format: List of Databases and collections
- Social media handling: Twitter | Facebook | Instagram | LinkedIn

2. Documentation.js - This file contains more extensive documentation and variables required for the marketplace. This essentially keeps Index.js clean
