### Intro

![EXPLORATION SECTION](https://i.ibb.co/jJwDjDq/image-2024-05-06-105734553.png)

We're Arthur Labs - this folder contains all of the Marketplace Variables, the primary variables is the index.js, and all customizable features foud in the styles.js

### Build your marketplace

1.  Index.js: Hosts your marketplace branding, type of marketplace, charge sales tax information, contract of implementation, database management and Web3 functionality
2.  Styles: Hosts your Light and Dark mode experience and notifications
3.  Form: Hosts your `Create Listing` section, these are all then added to the Sorting component found inside of the Explore section, and 2 images are brought to your index page
4.  Documentation: Hosts your documentation for the marketplace - customizing policies, terms and conditions, and contact


### Warning

* It is recommended to only modify the current code infrastructure if you're an experienced developer; if you only want to ideate a marketplace concept, then you should just adjust the variables. 
* The marketplace is dynamically configred, if you would like to modify beyond the variables, feel free to do so, but may cause redundencies or errors.
