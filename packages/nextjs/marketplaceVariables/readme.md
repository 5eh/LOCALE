### Intro

![EXPLORATION SECTION](https://i.ibb.co/gDgjf57/image-2024-04-30-123235379.png) - REPLACE WITH VARIABLE FILE

We're Arthur Labs - this folder contains the frontend application. If you are wanting to build a marketplace inside Polkadot, you can configurate its purpose and functionality inside of the `marketplaceVariables` folder.

### Build your marketplace

1.  `marketplaceVariables` - Modify variables
2.  `npm run deploy` 
3.  `npm run chain`
4.  `deploy to Vercel`

### Warning

It is recommended to only modify the current code infrastructure if you're an experienced developer; if you only want to ideate a marketplace concept, then you should just adjust the variables.
