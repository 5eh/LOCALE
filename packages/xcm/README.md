# XCM

## Intro

This is our XCM Exploration.  
Our goal was to create a simple price feed mechanism via XCM.  
The current default is using oracles.  
If you wanna know more about price feed, checkout [Chainlink docs - Price feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds)  
We checkout the [XCM-Demo](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/xcm-demo/tree/master). We settled on the Section `Moonbeam EVM smart contract automation`.

## Our Struggles

1. Getting the right binaries  
    Oak Collator - Check the 2 [issues](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/xcm-demo/issues/113) we have submitted to OAK Network repos
    Moonbeam - Moonbeam binary only showed runtime. Tried compiling the source code. It failed. Next version worked smoothly and had downloadable binary, which worked.  
   After finding all the correct versions, zombienet spawn up. ðŸ¥³

2. How to work with Zobmienet
   We had to modified the provided [moonbase.toml](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/blob/master/zombienets/turing/moonbase.toml) file to our local binaries.  
   That was not obvious in the beginning. At least a bit annoying. But ok.

3. Deploy via hardhat
   We encountered Issues, couldn't figured out in the first place where to look why deployment doesnt work.
   Is it zombienet, is it moonbeam. Is it the rpc port of xxx. Yeah, took a while.
   We followed the following steps.

   - Deploy on hardhat node
   - Spin up a moonbeam --dev, deploy on moonbeam. It didn't worked.
   - Solution was to use moonbeam in the following way `moonbeam --dev --ws-external --rpc-external --sealing 100`
   - Next up to spin up zombienet and deploy it there. It worked. Yeay ^^

4. Use moonbase-local.js scripts  
   This was horrible. First there are a bunch of polkadot warnings. Somewhen we solved that by locking the version. Alias remove the caret in package.json. We took the time to look in the necessary repos to find the correct versions to pin. 
   One of the confusing issues with the OAK XCM demo (other than the required transactAs param, see issue) was where, on the advice of documentation we found, we wrongly swapped the `transactAs` and `transaction` parameters to (`sendExtrinsicPromise`)[taskPayloadExtrinsic). The error we got ended up confusing us. When the transaction contained an object `V2`, our error told us `V2 not found in {V1, V3}`. When we changed it to `V3`, we got `V3 not found in {V1, V2}`!
    We were really happy that we got zombienet working smoothly and learned how to create a .toml file for chains.

## Our internal setup Instructions.

1. `wget https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/v0.9.43/polkadot`
2. `chmod +755`
3. `mv ./polkadot /usr/bin`
4a. `wget https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/releases/download/v2.0.0/oak-collator`
OR
4b. `wget https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/releases/download/v2.1.4/oak-collator`
5. `chmod +755 oak-collator`
6. `mv ./oak-collator /usr/bin`
7. `wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/v0.32.2/moonbeam`
8. `chmod +755 moonbeam`
9. `mv ./moonbeam /usr/bin`
10. `wget https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.102/zombienet-linux-x64`
11. `mv zombienet-linux-x64 zombienet`
12. `chmod +755 ./zombienet`
13. `mv ./zombienet /usr/bin`
14. `POLKADOT_CHAINS_PATH=/usr/bin`
15. `echo if POLKADOT_CHAINS_PATH $POLKADOT_CHAINS_PATH is not in PATH $PATH, then add it with PATH=PATH:$POLKADOT_CHAINS_PATH`
16. `# PATH=PATH:$POLKADOT_CHAINS_PATH`
17. `polkadot --version && oak-collator --version && moonbeam --version && zombienet version`

```
polkadot 0.9.43-ba42b9ce51d
oak-collator 2.0.0-a3ffd039d1a
moonbeam 0.32.2-d3172714146
1.3.100
```

15. `cat moonbase.toml`

### Run the process

1. `cd packages/xcm`
2. `zombienet spawn ./moonbase.toml`
3. `cd packages/xcm/src/moonbeam/contracts/`
4. `npx hardhat compile`
5. `npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js`
6. `export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<PASTEININCREMENTERCONTRACTADDRESS>"`
7. `cd packages/xcm/`
8. `npm run moonbase-local`
9. `<Error should appear, work in progress>`
